# Engenharia-de-Software-Desafio

Project I made to read and modify sheet files using the Google Drive API

Initially I accessed the Google Sheets API website https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts?hl=pt-br

Then I made a copy of the document delivered by the company and left the editable link for everyone. The link to the file used is: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19mqtt2mUu4H4tPn18PoGjPxln55vrpyDn4XT6NdHGMw/edit#gid=0

The language I chose to do this project was Python because the Python language makes it very easy to use data manipulation, something that I don't find so simple in Java (the second language I'm learning).

First , you need to install the library that we will use ("pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib")

Next, inside the file folder we open the terminal and type the command ("python3 quickstart.py")

When viewing the terminal screen we can see step by step what the program is doing.
